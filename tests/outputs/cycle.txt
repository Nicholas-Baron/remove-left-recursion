Symbol mapping (Negative = terminal):
-3 -->  b
-2 -->  c
-1 -->  a
 0 -->  |
 1 -->  A
 2 -->  B
 3 -->  C
 4 -->  D
Rules:
 1 -->  1 -1  |  2 
 2 -->  3  |  1 -1 
 3 -->  4  | -2  2 
 4 -->  1  | -3 -3 
Rules Prettified:
 A -->  A  a  |  B 
 B -->  C  |  A  a 
 C -->  D  |  c  B 
 D -->  A  |  b  b 


Epsilon check
1 has epsilon? false
