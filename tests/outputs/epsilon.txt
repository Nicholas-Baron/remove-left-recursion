Using token 1 for nonterminal A
Symbol mapping (Negative = terminal):
-2 -->  

-1 -->  a
 0 -->  |
 1 -->  A
Rules:
 1 -->  1 -1  | -2 
Rules Prettified:
 A -->  A  a  |  
 


Epsilon check
1 has epsilon? false

Cycle check
Could not find cycle

Before immediate recursion removal for nonterm 1(sym A):
 1 -1
 -2
Removed all left recursion from the grammar
Symbol mapping (Negative = terminal):
-2 -->  

-1 -->  a

 1 -->  A
 2 -->  B
Rules:
 1 --> -2  2 
 2 -->  | -1  2
